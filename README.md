# Hi, I'm Goutham Kumar

I'm a 10th-grade student from India, passionate about coding, teaching, and building tools that help others — all using a 4GB Celeron laptop and mobile hotspot internet.

Despite limited resources, I’ve created and maintained full projects, games, and platforms — all open-source and built with dedication and curiosity.

If you're here from LTT, Reddit, or anywhere else — thank you for taking the time to visit.  
I build because I love it, and I teach because I wish someone had done the same for me.
